# SilverBot
SilverBot is a multi-purpose Discord Bot developed by Chris Foster and Judah Goff.

SilverBot is made as a learning exercise in JavaScript.

Silverbot has a variety of commands.

@Silverbot meme -*name of meme or meme ID*- "text" "box"
  The meme command uses imgflip meme templates. Find the Meme ID in the URL (can support custom uploads) and fill in the number of text boxes in the quotes.
 
@Silverbot level
  The level command tells you your Level in the bot's experience tracker. Based on messages sent (limit 1 message a minute tracked).
  
@Silverbot portal "x" "y" "z"
  The portal command will calculate where in the Nether your Nether Portal must be to reach the input coordinates.
  
@Silverbot info
  The info command will show the age of your account and when you joined the server the command is used in.
  
@Silverbot aesthetic "message"
  The aesthetic command will resend your message with spaces between the words.
  
@Silverbot Help
  The help command will send you here.
  
@Silverbot store "input" "output"
  The store command will allow you to custom create a response command. Whatever you place in the input will have the output respose when you type '@Silverbot input'.
  
@Silverbot link "input" "output"
  The link command is the same as the store command except you do not need to ping the bot to have it respond. Once you use the command simply typing the input in chat will work.
  
@Silverbot commands/links
  The commands or links command will return a list of either all stored commands or stored links. Very spammy.
  
--
The commands do not require pinging the bot.

'lightrightnow' will summon the bot to play a wonderful song.

'get on your boots' will return a wonderful lyric.

'ree' will make the bot react.
